# I think the simplest way is to set the password for the keyring to an empty password -- 
# you will not be prompted for a password then:

# 1) Open Settings -> Applications -> Accessories -> 
# or 
# search directly Password and Encryption Keys
# 2) Right-click on the "login" keyring
# 3) Select "Change password"
# 4) Enter your old password and leave the new password blank
# 5) Press ok, read the security warning, think about it and if you still want to get rid of this dialog, 
# choose "use unsafe storage".
