The best way is to disable the pcspkr driver, 
that way you don't have to undo any hardware changes in the future. 
Open up a terminal and enter the following:
sudo modprobe -r pcspkr

Then, if you want to avoid doing this every time after rebooting, 
append the following line to your /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist file. 
If it's not there, create it.

blacklist pcspkr
